        <h1>Bacon History</h1>
        
        <p class="quote">
            Bacon is a meat product usually prepared from pork and cured. It is first cured using large quantities of salt, either
            a brine or a dry packing, and the result is fresh bacon or green bacon. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in 
            cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by frying. Boiled 
            bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating.

        <p>
            Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from side and back cuts of pork, or from the pork belly. 
            A side cut has less fat than the belly. In the United States, the term implies "belly" bacon, with leaner cuts known as Canadian bacon. 
            In the United Kingdom, loin bacon with some belly attached is known as "back bacon", or rashers, and belly bacon is called "streaky bacon". 
            Bacon may be prepared from one of two distinct back cuts: fatback, which is almost pure fat, or pork loin, which is very lean.
